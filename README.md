# Choose Your Professor 🎓

Hi! My name is **Viknesh Ashokkumar**. I’m a **full-time student** at Long Beach City College and also a **student college advisor**. I built this project as part of the **SNAP Academies** to help students make better choices when selecting professors and counselors.

## 🔍 What This Site Does

**Choose Your Professor** is a clean, ad-free alternative to RateMyProfessor — built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It lets students:
- 🔍 Search for professors or counselors by name
- 🧪 Filter by department (like Math, CS, EOPS, etc.)
- ⭐ Filter by minimum rating (4.0+, 4.5+, 4.8+)

This is a **personal side project** meant for fun and to help students, not for commercial use or criticism.

## 💡 Why I Made This

As a student college advisor, I’ve seen how frustrating it is for students trying to:
- Pick a professor that matches their learning style
- Find a counselor who actually helps them transfer on time

The real RateMyProfessor site is cluttered with ads, bugs, and often inaccurate data. I wanted to build something **cleaner, simpler, and more relevant** — starting with **LBCC** data.

Maybe one day, I’ll scale it up to include every college in the world 🌍
